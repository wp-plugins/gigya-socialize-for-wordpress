How does the authentication part work?

New visitors can register on your site using the built-in Gigya Social Login component. The site will create a Wordpress user account in the database and connect the social network account to that user.
Existing site users can link their existing Wordpress account to their social network account or accounts.

Can I configure the design of the Gigya component?

Yes, the design is fully configurable. Please login to your Gigya account (on www.gigya.com) to use our online component designer. When you are done designing, you can easily copy the configuration code to your Gigya admin settings page.
